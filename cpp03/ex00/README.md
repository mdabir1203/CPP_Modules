Based on the instructions and assumptions, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. ClapTrap class: This is the main class that represents a ClapTrap. It has private attributes for name, hitPoints, energyPoints, and attackDamage, and public member functions for attack, takeDamage, and beRepaired.

2. ClapTrap constructor: This function initializes a ClapTrap object with a given name and default values for hitPoints, energyPoints, and attackDamage.

3. ClapTrap destructor: This function is called when a ClapTrap object is destroyed.

4. attack function: This function simulates an attack by the ClapTrap on a given target. It checks if the ClapTrap has enough energyPoints to perform the action, reduces the energyPoints by 1 if it does, and prints a message.

5. takeDamage function: This function simulates the ClapTrap taking damage. It checks if the ClapTrap has enough hitPoints to sustain the damage, reduces the hitPoints by the amount of damage if it does, and prints a message.

6. beRepaired function: This function simulates the ClapTrap being repaired. It checks if the ClapTrap has enough energyPoints to perform the action, reduces the energyPoints by 1 and increases the hitPoints by the amount of repair if it does, and prints a message.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

ClapTrap.hpp
